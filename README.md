# Emotion_recognition_task
This is a pilot study with a limited trial set that adapts the stroop task by using facial and tone based expression of emotion. The participant is presented with a face (male/female) along with an audio (mix of words and non-words) that convey any of the following emotions - happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust. The participant uses the keyboard to identify which emotion the voice is expressing regardless of the emotion they can see on the person's face.
